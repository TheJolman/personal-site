              I first attended college at El Camino Community College in
              Torrance, CA. There I played collegiate tennis and earned two
              associate degrees: Mathematics and General Studies w/ emphpasis in
              Physical Sciences. After five semesters I had fully transferred to
              CSU, Fullerton where I am now, in my final semester. My degree
              will be in CS with a minor in Math. I am a board member of my
              schools ACM chapter where I co-lead one of our open-source
              projects.

              I'm a huge Linux enthusiast (take a look at my{"  "}

              </a>) and generally into tech. I enjoy self-hosting things on my
              home server, writing code, and optiimizing my workflow. While I
              can't call myself an engineer, I enjoy tinkering with physical
              hardware, and fixing/upgrading devices when I can.
            </p>

            <p className="">
              Besides school and software, I'm interested in literature and
              music, as well as various sports. Some of my favorite authors are
              George R. R. Martin, Vladimir Nabokov, and Sylvia Plath. I've
              played tennis competetively up until recently, and I also enjoy
              golf and snowboarding (although my wallet doesn't).
            </p>

            <p className="">
              Finally, I've been working as an instructor at various Mathnasium
              locations for nearly two years at this point, and I do private
              tutoring as well when the opportunity presents itself.

                I've worked a few different, unrelated jobs. First as a hospital
                warehouse worker, then (I occassionally still do) as a tennis
                instructor, and now as a math instructor. The last two positions
                have largely been jobs where I work with kids, which I enjoy.
